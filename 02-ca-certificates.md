# Generate Your Client-Facing and AKS Ingress Controller TLS Certificates

Now that you have the [prerequisites](./01-prerequisites.md) met, follow the steps below to create the TLS certificates that Azure Application Gateway will serve for clients connecting to your web app as well as the AKS Ingress Controller. If you already have access to an appropriate certificates, or can procure them from your organization, consider doing so and skipping the certificate generation steps. The following will describe using a self-signed certs for instructive purposes only.

## Steps

1. Generate a client-facing self-signed TLS certificate

   > :book: Contoso Bicycle needs to procure a CA certificate for the web site. As this is going to be a user-facing site, they purchase an EV cert from their CA. This will serve in front of the Azure Application Gateway. They will also procure another one, a standard cert, to be used with the AKS Ingress Controller. This one is not EV, as it will not be user facing.

   :warning: Front Door does not support self-signed certificates

   Create the certificate for Azure Application Gateway. A CA certificate is needed. You can use your company domain or try get a certificate for each domain using [Azure subdomain certificates](./certificate-generation/README.md).
   It is expected two certificates, one per each Application Gateway. We called bicycle3.pfx and bicycle4.pfx, using bicycle3 and bicycle4 as azure subdomains.

1. Base64 encode the client-facing certificate

   :bulb: No matter if you used a certificate from your organization or you generated one from above, you'll need the certificate (as `.pfx`) to be base 64 encoded for proper storage in Key Vault later.

   ```bash
   export APP_GATEWAY_LISTENER_CERTIFICATE_BICYCLE3=$(cat bicycle3.pfx | base64 | tr -d '\n')
   export APP_GATEWAY_LISTENER_CERTIFICATE_BICYCLE4=$(cat bicycle4.pfx | base64 | tr -d '\n')
   ```

1. Generate the wildcard certificate for the AKS Ingress Controller

   > :book: Contoso Bicycle will also procure another TLS certificate, a standard cert, to be used with the AKS Ingress Controller. This one is not EV, as it will not be user facing. Finally the app team decides to use a wildcard certificate of `*.aks-ingress.contoso.com` for the ingress controller.

   ```bash
   openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -out traefik-ingress-internal-aks-ingress-contoso-com-tls.crt -keyout traefik-ingress-internal-aks-ingress-contoso-com-tls.key -subj "/CN=*.aks-ingress.contoso.com/O=Contoso Aks Ingress"
   ```

1. Base64 encode the AKS Ingress Controller certificate

   :bulb: No matter if you used a certificate from your organization or you generated one from above, you'll need the public certificate (as `.crt` or `.cer`) to be base 64 encoded for proper storage in Key Vault later.

   ```bash
   export AKS_INGRESS_CONTROLLER_CERTIFICATE_BASE64=$(cat traefik-ingress-internal-aks-ingress-contoso-com-tls.crt | base64 | tr -d '\n')
   ```
